# Smallest-Enclosing-Circle
Given a set of points on a 2D plane the task is to find the smallest circle made up of 2 or 3 points that encloses all points.
2 Different solutions are given:
# Brute force with a time complexity of O(n^3)
# Emo Welzl's optimized algorithm with a time complexity of O(n)
